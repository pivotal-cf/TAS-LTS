# TAS-LTS

This repository will house information related to access, installation, and maintenance of supported products under the TAS (formerly CF / PAS) umbrella. Much of this is covered in `cf-onboarding` and will be omitted from this repository and corresponding wiki.

# Maintainer Note

This exports pretty cleanly from Roam Research markdown export, except for code blocks. All you need to do is indent those code blocks to be at a greater indentation level than their parent list items.
